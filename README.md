# Bobsie-Crypter

## What is this

An html file containg all the html, css and javascript to be a little username / password (and other information) storage system that is AES encrypted.

## Why?

You know how you have all kind of passwords or login information digital and analog spread all over different places? Me too, so I created this here.

### Why html?

Compatibility of course. Everybody has a browser and you do not need any additional plugin or software and it is compatible with many different systems (not mobile optimized at the moment though).
It is just a file and the systems already have the tools, no additional stuff but a browsers and maybe a texteditor for nerd stuff.

## Features

### General
* **All in one file**
* **No extra software needed (just a browser)**
* Table with 6 cells for one username:password entrie and descriptions or whatever you want
* Direct **AES de- and encryption**
* New entries can be **inserted directly** within the file itself.
* **Filter function** to just show what contains a string.
* **Edit** and **delete** existing entries.
